I'm a Computer Science senior at the University of Michigan, where I spent most of my time as an IT consultant for the Biomedical Engineering Department. In January, I'll be working as a Software Engineer Intern at **Mercury**.

I previously interned as a Software Engineer Intern at **Capital One**, **Uber**, and **Amazon**, and I won first place in the Capital One Banking for Good and JP Morgan Chase Coding for Good hackathons.

I'm also a tech creator on LinkedIn/X. In fact, I was once awarded a scholarship by OpenAI for my contributions to the tech community.

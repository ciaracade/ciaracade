Hi, I'm [Ciara](https://www.ciaracade.com). 🧝🏼‍♀️

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. I'm currently doing a **Software Developer Engineer internship with Amazon** and I've previously done SWE internships at Uber and Capital One. I also work with the University of Michigan Department of Biomedical Engineering as an IT Consultant and Student Developer. 

I've won first place at two hackathons with Capital One and JP Morgan Chase, and I've been previously awarded a scholarship by Open AI for my contributions to the tech community.

Building [SourceShip.dev](https://www.sourceship.dev/), the open source internship alternative.

💗 I love LLM tools. \
💗 I love gaming on my Playstation and my PC. \
💗 I'm studying for my intermediate Japanese Language Proficiency Exam (JLPT N3)
